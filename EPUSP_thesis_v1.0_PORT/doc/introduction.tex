Here you should give the context, justifications...

Do yourself a favor and follow the structure guidelines in the file $Research\_structure\_guidelines.txt$.
It should make your life easier.

I left parts of my thesis as an example in my GitHub respository (\url{https://github.com/fbarbieri77}).
There you will find the syntax of a variety of commands about how to cite, include figures, tables, reference equations, formatting, etc.

In order to translate the default texts to another language you will need only to change the text at the end of the file "/EPUSPclass/definitions.tex" and change the language in the command line $usepackage[english]{babel}$ to $usepackage[brazil]{babel}$, for instance, in the main file.
Another option is to use the Portuguese version in my GitHub respository.

Have fun!!!
