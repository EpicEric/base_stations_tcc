\chapter{Revis\~ ao da Literatura} \label{chap:lit}


In your thesis you should update the file $/doc/bibliography.bib$ with your literature review papers.
Then you need to update the file $thesis\_main.bbl$ everytime you mention a new paper in the document.
I use TexMaker for linux and it is done by just pressing F11.

Examples of citation of one paper and multiple papers: We have studies that considered ... \cite{lim}, or cross terms ... \cite{luo}, or even studies that... \cite{liu,li2003,zhu2005}.
