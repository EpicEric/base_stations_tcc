% This file contains the changes in the previous class file of prof. Paulo
% Barreto as well as the overview of the main changes I took to stablish a
% new structure to the class
%
% Recommended versioning guidelines
%
% refer to the version label vX.Y.Z
%	- add 1 to X if you have performed a drastic overhaul by simplifying or 
%	  updating the sofware commands, environments, macros, etc, keeping in
%	  mind that the end result should be easy to update by non-experts
%	- add 1 to Y if you have performed small changes or updates in the
%	  sofware commands, environments, macros, etc. (things related to Latex)
%	- add 1 to Z if you have updated the formatting, packages used, or other
%	  small changes related to the either the ABNT rules or Poli guidelines
%	- there is no need to create a different version if you change the 
%	  language of the text (current in English as should be all scientific texts,
%	  if we were in the 18th century I would had written this class in Latin!)

%  ---------------

% $Log: abnt.cls,v $
% Revision 1.21.2.1  2003/05/30 10:16:07  gweber
% Correction of bug 137 which causes the class to fail when loading
% the package hyperref and using \tableofcontents.
% This also resolves partially bugs 82 and 51.
%
%
% Added in version 1.1 patch 1
%
% - fixed bug of undefined \ABNT<section name>mark, which shows twice the
%   section name (only for subsection, subsubsection, and paragraph)
%
% Added in version 1.1
%
% - Fixed bug of missing paragraphy after \chapter
% - \ProximoForaDoSumario has optional parameter to et page marks
% - Fixed bug of abscense of package setspace.
% - Added options `abntfigtabnum' and `normalfigtabnum' to deal with
%   figure and table counters.
% - Added abnt style for toc. Options `abnttoc' and
%   `normaltoc' were added.
% - Fixed bug of defining pagestyles only if non-noheader.
%
% Added in version 1 (finally)
%
% - Fixed mispelling on command \espaco.
% - Fixed "capsec" (not working before).
% - Added full support for Annex and Appendix, with several class options
%   and commands for customization.
% - Not using package "textcase" anymore, since there is a undesirable
%   extra space included with \MakeUppercase.
% - Fixed default options. Now "openright" is really default.
% - Now using feature of "setspace" to avoid extra spacing on display
%   math. No bugs if the version of setspace is not up to date.
% - Added \ProximoForaDoSumario, to avoid one to not include all \chapter*
%   if one wants to set diferently the title and contents of such chapters.
% - Fixed bug on \part toc entries (buggy extra space)
% - Now font size for \capter(*) is given by \ABNTchaptersize, preventing a
%   boring redefinition of \ABNTtocchapterfont.
% - Option paccomuns no longer default.
%
% Added in version 1 beta 3
%
% - Fixed bug in page marks for \section*{}.
% - "setspace" no longer require especific (new) version.
% - Added "no displayskip stretch" support offered by 'setspace' for better
%   aesthetic.
% - Added compatibility with "hyperref" package (no more incompatible
%   optional parameter on \chapter* -- hyperref redefines some commands)
% - Useless commands removed: \cabecalhoesq and \cabecalhodir.
%
% Added in version 1 beta 2
%
% - Correct figure and table counter.
% - Some support to "folha de apresentacao", including environment
%     \begin{folhadeapresentacao} e \assinatura{} (signature).
% - Fixed bug in pnumplain and headers.
% - Fixed bug in page marks for \@schapter.
%
% Added in version 1 beta
%
%   Total reformulation of the class! The main added feature are:
% - Good machanism for "Folha de Rosto" (face page) added.
% - Page numbering squemes according to the norms.
% - Right page headings.
% - Correct section titles.
% - Several options added.
% - Features removed, like margin care
% ...too many changes to list. Just like a "new" class.
%
% Added in version 0.4.3
%
% - Stupid but severe bug on \listoffigures and \listoftables 
%     left from previous version finally removed
% - Bug fixes in theindex and thebibliography
% - Redefinition of \cleardoublepage (empty page => page style empty)
% - This `list of changes' added
%
% Added in version 0.4.2
%
% - Added \StarChaptersInTOC, \StarChaptersNotInTOC to differenciate  
%    from "standard" (old) stared chapters like \tableofcontents,
%    \listoffigures, \listoftables, thebibliography and theindex.
% - Huge bugs in commands or environments \tableofcontents, \listoffigures,
%    \listoftables, thebibliography and theindex fixed.
% - Command \SpAcEs changed to \spABNT (more reliable than before)
%
% Added in version 0.4.1
%
% - Extract forgotten debug command
% - Fix conflict (\Sp command) in final messagem, creating \SpAcEs (and
%     hoping nobody made it before)
%
%
% New changes and file restructuring by Fabio Barbieri
% Restructuring and update of the file abnt.cls, version 1.21.2.1 of 05/30/2003
%
% - The main changes implemented were:
% 	- structuring of the file into multiple files in order to ease maintenance
%	- consolidation of the main formatting definitions in one file
%	  (definitions.tex) in order to ease the updates of the unfortunately
%	  quite frequent changes in the ABNT and Poli guidelines
%	- adaptation and update of some environments and packages (abnTex2, etc)
%	- rename the class file to epusp_1.0.0.cls and restart the versioning
%	  according with specific rules for further changes (see the main class
%	  file for details)
%	- I performed many updates and changes over the whole class and the main 
%	  file before I realise there should be a new class file and that is the
%	  only reason I do not show more detailed information about every single change.
%	  I decided to start an almost fresh version and provide an easier way for 
%	  updating and contributions from the community
%
% Added in version ?
