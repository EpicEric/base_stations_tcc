# EPUSP_thesis_template
Thesis template for Escola Polit√©cnica - USP

This template was based on the works of Miguel Vinicius Santini Frasson and Paulo Barreto.
I implemented a new structure with some updates that I hope will facilitate future changes.

This template has been given to you free of charges and it is the combined work of people who could and wanted to help the university community. 
Please, if you have the skills to improve this class, please, do so and share it with everybody else.
