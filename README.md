# EPUSP_thesis_template
Thesis template for Escola Polit√©cnica - USP

EPUSP_thesis_template_v1.0 := folder with template in English
EPUSP_thesis_v1.0_PORT := folder with template in Portuguese
EPUSP_thesis_example := folder with parts of my thesis to help with LaTex syntax and command examples

This template was based on the works of Miguel Vinicius Santini Frasson and Paulo Barreto.
I implemented a new structure with some updates that I hope will facilitate future changes.

This template has been given to you free of charges and it is the combined work of people who could and wanted to help the university community. 
Please, if you have the skills to improve this class, please, do so and share it with everybody else.
